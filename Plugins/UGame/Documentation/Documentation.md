# Features
* This project cotains three main features, where the description can be found in the following documents:
  * [A realistic walking simulation, where the character speed up over time](RealisticWalking.md)
  * [Clickable objects with a menu like interaction system](ClickableObjects.md)
  * [Rotation, drop and pickup interactions with objects](RotationPickupDrop.md)

# Bugs
* Since the update 4.20 of the unreal engine it is necessary to press the mouse buttons twice to start the interactions with the objects or remove the cursor.  

* Objects on the floor can be picked up and if they are moved to the rotation position the screen of the character stay at the lock down posiion.
