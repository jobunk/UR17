## Project description
- A physics constraint that helps bottles to have realistic behavior at opening them.
- Easy to use

## Milestones
- Milestone 1:
	- Creating an editor plugin for a screw joint between 2 mesh actors.
	- Screw joint constraints the movement in one direction.
	- Destroy the constraint after moving the lid by a fixed degree.
	
- Milestone 2:
	- Parameterize
		- Angle (standard value = 60°)
		- Turning way (standard value = right)
		- Height of threaded area
		- Number of turns to open
		- Approximate lead as ratio height/no of turns
	- Make lid travel linearly up/down on the threaded axis while rotating it

- Milestone 3:
	- Getting lid up/down moving to work.
		- Should work in every rotation.
		- Calculated by the turned degree.
	- Getting a friction/dumping force.
	- Creating a debug mode.
	- Putting documentation in markdown on GitHub.
