# How to install and start the FleX-Kitchen

Two methods exist to install and start the Flex-Kitchen.

**First case:**

Create a copy from this [repository](https://github.com/robcog-iai/RobCoG). Go to the branch dev-flex and add the Plugins with the command *'git submodule update --init --recursive'*. Next go to this [repository](https://github.com/robcog-iai/UR17/tree/ur17-p6) and download the map, the flex folder and the water tap plugin. Subsequently, only these files have to be added to the dev-flex project. 

**Second case:**

Create a copy from this [repository](https://github.com/robcog-iai/UR17/tree/ur17-p6) and add all Plugins from this [repository](https://github.com/robcog-iai/RobCoG/tree/dev-flex). 
They can be manually downloaded or added by the command *'git submodule update --init --recursive'*.
