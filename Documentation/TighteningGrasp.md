## What is Tightening Grasp?


Tightening Grasp is an experimental feature, with the goal to be able to grasp very small objects. 
After the player has pushed the grasping button for a certain amount of time, the target rotation of all bones is increased by a certain percentage in order to artificially increase the pressure exerted by the hand.
There is also the option to set a threshhold and only if a fingers rotation is displaced by more degrees than the threshold, the fingers target rotation gets increased.
This threshhold is set to 0 by default, so every fingers target rotation always gets increased.
Tightening Grasp is disabled by default.
